# query-excel-with-python

This is a small program i wrote to look through many excel files. At work we have a folder with subfolders and excel sheets in them. 
So this program walks through each subdirectory, finds all excel sheets and adds them to an array. When you start the program, you can enter
keywords that wou want to search for in the headers. For example if you have a column called "address," and you want to return ALL rows in that 
column, you would enter "address" as a keyword. Pretty helpful program and can be added on to easily.
